# Python Matrix Code Rainer
Inspired from The Matrix / CMatrix. Rains strings of random characters in your terminal.
Built on Python's "curses" package, which is unfortunately not compatible with
Windows without some workarounds being done. This should run on any Unix based OS though.

The code is done as a stylistic exercise in programming object-oriented python(A.K.A: 'POOPy'). Probably the most ideal way to do it,
as I wanted to mess with class oriented concatenated knowledge bases(A.K.A the 'COCK' paradigm).
