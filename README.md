# Python Matrix Code Rainer
Inspired from The Matrix / CMatrix. Rains strings of random characters in your terminal.
Built on Python's "curses" package, which is unfortunately not compatible with
Windows without some workarounds being done. This should run on any Unix based OS though.

The code is done in a very object-oriented way. Probably not the most ideal way to do it,
but I wanted to mess around with classes in Python.
